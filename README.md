**Inspiration**

YogX was inspired by a desire to combine technology with wellness. In order to prevent people from doing wrong yoga asana's, we envisioned a platform that harnessed the power of machine learning . Our objectives are to increase general wellbeing, encourage proper form, and make yoga accessible.


**What it does**

YogX uses webcam and machine learning to analyze and correct yoga postures, aiding practitioners in achieving proper form and alignment.


**How we built it**

YogX was built using web development tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ml5.js, p5.js,posenet), integrated with machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV) for posture detection, and webcam access through browser APIs. It's hosted on a secure server for online accessibility.


**Challenges we ran into**

Collecting data and training model


**Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We are proud of creating YogX, a platform that empowers users to improve their yoga practice and enhance their well-being through technology.


**What we learned**

Through the development of YogX, we learned valuable lessons in machine learning model optimization, user experience design, and the importance of privacy and data security in online platforms. We also gained insights into the intersection of technology and wellness.


**What's next for Yogx**

Offline application support as an ai instructor with feature of routine management and efficacy of asanas.
